Animals
Animals are diverse organisms that inhabit almost every corner of the planet. They range from
tiny insects to massive whales, each playing a unique role in their ecosystems. Animals can be
categorized into various groups, including mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, and amphibians. They
rely on different sources for survival, with some being herbivores, others carnivores, and many
omnivores. Many species exhibit complex behaviors, social structures, and communication
methods. Animals are essential for maintaining ecological balance, contributing to pollination,
seed dispersal, and nutrient cycles. Their well-being is closely tied to environmental health,
making conservation efforts critical for biodiversity
